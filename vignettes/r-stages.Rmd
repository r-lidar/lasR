`lasR` is a standalone software that can work independently outside of R. The R part of `lasR` is only an API to conveniently build pipelines, but this task could be performed by another software such as a Python package, a QGIS plugin, or dedicated software. Currently, the only existing API is the `lasR` package.

However, the R package version offers additional stages that allow injecting R code into the pipeline. These stages cannot exist in standalone software independent of R.

## Rasterize

In the [tutorial](tutorial.html), we mentioned that `rasterize()` supports the injection of a user-defined R expression. This is equivalent to `pixel_metrics()` from the package `lidR`. Any user-defined function can be mapped, making it extremely versatile but slower.

Let's compute the map of the median intensity by injecting a user-defined expression. Like in `lidR`, the attributes of the point cloud are named: `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Intensity`, `gpstime`, `ReturnNumber`, `NumberOfreturns`, `Classification`, `UserData`, `PointSourceID`, `R`, `G`, `B`, `NIR`. For users familiar with the `lidR` package, note that there is no `ScanAngleRank/ScanAngle`;  instead the scanner angle is always named `ScanAngle` and is numeric. Also flags are named `Withheld`, `Synthetic` and `Keypoint`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
f <- system.file("extdata", "Topography.las", package="lasR")
```

```{r rasterize3, fig.height=3.5}
pipeline = rasterize(10, median(Intensity))
ans = exec(pipeline, on = f)

terra::plot(ans, mar = c(1, 1, 1, 3), col = heat.colors(15))
```

<blockquote style="background-color: #d6e9f9; border-left: 5px solid #428bca; padding: 10px; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 5px;">
Notice that, in this specific case, using `rasterize(10, "i_median")` is more efficient.
</blockquote>

## Callback

The `callback` stage holds significant importance as the second and last entry point to inject R code into the pipeline, following `rasterize()`. For those familiar with the `lidR` package, the initial step often involves reading data with `lidR::readLAS()` to expose the point cloud as a `data.frame` object in R. In contrast, `lasR` loads the point cloud optimally in C++ without exposing it directly to R. However, with `callback`, it becomes possible to expose the point cloud as a `data.frame` for executing specific R functions.

Similar to `lidR`, the attributes of the point cloud in `lasR` are named: `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Intensity`, `gpstime`, `ReturnNumber`, `NumberOfreturns`, `Classification`, `UserData`, `PointSourceID`, `R`, `G`, `B`, `NIR`. Notably, for users accustomed to the `lidR` package, the scanner angle is consistently named `ScanAngle` and is numeric, as opposed to `ScanAngleRank/ScanAngle`. Additionally, flags are named `Withheld`, `Synthetic`, and `Keypoint`.

Let's delve into a simple example. For each LAS file, the `callback` loads the point cloud as a `data.frame` and invokes the `meanz()` function on the `data.frame`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
f <- c(system.file("extdata", "Topography.las", package="lasR"), system.file("extdata", "Megaplot.las", package="lasR"))
```

```{r callback}
meanz = function(data){ return(mean(data$Z)) }
call = callback(meanz, expose = "xyz")
ans = exec(call, on = f)
print(ans)
```
Here the output is a `list` with two elements because we processed two files (`f` is not displayed in this document). The average Z elevation are respectively 809.08 and 13.27 in each file.

<blockquote style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 5px solid #ffc107; padding: 10px; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 5px;">
Be mindful that, for a given LAS/LAZ file, the point cloud may contain more points than the original file **if the file is loaded with a buffer**. Further clarification on this matter will be provided later.
</blockquote>

The `callback` function is versatile and can also be employed to edit the point cloud. When the user-defined function returns a `data.frame` with the same number of rows as the original one, the function edits the underlying C++ dataset. This enables users to perform tasks such as assigning a class to a specific point. While physically removing points is not possible, users can flag points as `Withheld`. In such cases, these points will not be processed in subsequent stages, they are discarded.


```{r callback2}
edit_points = function(data)
{
  data$Classification[5:7] = c(2L,2L,2L)
  data$Withheld = FALSE
  data$Withheld[12] = TRUE
  return(data)
}

call = callback(edit_points, expose = "xyzc")
ans = exec(call, on = f)
ans
```

As observed, here, this time `callback` does not explicitly return anything; however, it edited the point cloud internally. To generate an output, users must use another stage such as `write_las()`. It's important to note that `write_las()` will **NOT** write the point number 12 which is flagged `withheld`. Neither any subsequent stage will process it. The point is still in memory but is discarded.

<blockquote style="background-color: #f8d7da; border-left: 5px solid #dc3545; padding: 10px; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 5px;">
For memory and efficiency reasons, it is not possible to physically remove a point from the underlying memory in `lasR`. Instead, the points flagged as `withheld` will **never be processed**. One consequence of this, is that points flagged as withheld in a LAS/LAZ file **will not** be processed in `lasR`. This aligns with the intended purpose of the flag according to the LAS specification but may differ from the default behavior of many software on the market including `lidR`.
</blockquote>

Now, let's explore the capabilities of `callback` further. First, let's create a lidR-like `read_las()` function to expose the point cloud to R. In the following example, the user-defined function is employed to return the `data.frame` as is. When the user's function returns a `data.frame` with the same number of points as the original dataset, this updates the points at the C++ level. Here, we use `no_las_update = TRUE` to explicitly return the result.


```{r callback3}
read_las = function(f, select = "xyzi", filter = "")
{
  load = function(data) { return(data) }
  read = reader(filter = filter)
  call = callback(load, expose = select, no_las_update = TRUE)
  return (exec(read+call, on = f))
}

f <- system.file("extdata", "Topography.las", package="lasR")
las = read_las(f)
head(las)
```

Ground points can also be classified using an R function, such as the one provided by the `RCSF` package:

```r
csf = function(data)
{
  id = RCSF::CSF(data)
  class = integer(nrow(data))
  class[id] = 2L
  data$Classification <- class
  return(data)
}

read = reader()
classify = callback(csf, expose = "xyz")
write = write_las()
pipeline = read + classify + write
exec(pipeline, on = f)
```

<blockquote style="background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 5px solid #ffc107; padding: 10px; font-size: 14px; border-radius: 5px;">
`callback()` exposes the point cloud as a `data.frame`. This is the only way to expose the point clouds to users in a manageable way. One of the reasons why `lasR` is more memory-efficient and faster than `lidR` is that it **does not** expose the point cloud as a `data.frame`. Thus, the pipelines using `callback()` are not significantly different from `lidR`. The advantage of using `lasR` here is the ability to pipe different stages.
</blockquote>

## Buffer

Point clouds are typically stored in multiple contiguous files. To avoid edge artifacts, each file must be loaded with extra points coming from neighboring files. Everything is handled automatically, except for the `callback()` stage. In `callback()`, the point cloud is exposed as a `data.frame` with the buffer, providing the user-defined function with some spatial context. If `callback` is used to edit the points, everything is handled internally. However, if an R object is returned, it is the responsibility of the user to handle the buffer.

For example, in the following pipeline, we are processing two files, and `callback()` is used to count the number of points. The presence of `triangulate()` implies that each file will be loaded with a buffer to make a valid triangulation. Consequently, counting the points in `callback()` returns more points than `summarise()` because `summarise()` is an internal function that knows how to deal with the buffer.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
f = paste0(system.file(package="lasR"), "/extdata/bcts")
f = list.files(f, pattern = "(?i)\\.la(s|z)$", full.names = TRUE)
f = f[1:2]
```

```{r buffer}
count = function(data) { length(data$X) }
del = triangulate(filter = keep_ground())
npts = callback(count, expose = "x")
sum = summarise()
ans = exec(del + npts + sum, on = f)
print(ans$callback)
ans$callback[[1]]+ ans$callback[[2]]
ans$summary$npoints
```

We can compare this with the pipeline without `triangulate()`. In this case, there is no reason to use a buffer, and the files are not buffered. The counts are equal.


```{r buffer2}
ans = exec(npts + sum, on = f)
ans$callback[[1]]+ ans$callback[[2]]
ans$summary$npoints
```

To handle the buffer, the user can read the attribute `bbox` of the `data.frame`. It contains the bounding box of the point cloud without the buffer or use the column `Buffer` that contains `TRUE` or `FALSE` for each point. If `TRUE`, the point is in the buffer. The buffer is exposed only if the user includes the letter `'b'`.

```{r buffer3}
count_buffer_aware = function(data) {
  bbox = attr(data, "bbox")
  npoints = sum(!data$Buffer)
  return(list(bbox = bbox, npoints = npoints))
}

del = triangulate(filter = keep_ground())
npts = callback(count_buffer_aware, expose = "b") # b for buffer
sum = summarise()
ans = exec(del + npts + sum, on = f)
print(ans$callback)
ans$callback[[1]]$npoints+ ans$callback[[2]]$npoints
ans$summary$npoints
```

In conclusion, in the hypothesis that the user-defined function returns something complex, there are two ways to handle the buffer: either using the bounding box or using the `Buffer` flag. A third option is to use `drop_buffer`. In this case users ensure to receive a `data.frame` that does not include points from the buffer.

## Parallelisation

R is **NOT** multi-threaded, and thus calling these stages in parallel is not thread-safe and will crash the R session in the best case or deeply corrupt the R memory in the worst case. Consequently, these stages are protected and cannot run concurrently with a `concurrent-file` strategy. These stages are only meant to build complex but convenient pipelines and do not intend to be production tools. While `lasR::rasterize(10, mymetrics(Z, Intensity))` produces the same output as `lidR::pixel_metrics(las, mymetrics(Z, Intensity), 10)`, the `lidR` version is faster because it can be parallelized on **multiple R sessions**.

`lasR`, on the other hand, parallelizes the computation in a **single R session**. This approach has pros and cons which won't be discussed in this tutorial. One con is that pipelines using injected R code are not parallelizable by default.


<!--
When a pipeline has stages that use the R API (in orange in the figure below), the stages that use R are blocking the other stages that are waiting (see figure below).


![](concurent_points_with_R.png){width=600px}

Of course, as depicted in the diagram above, this incurs a computational time cost. If the blocking stages take a lot of time compared to the other stages it could even defeat the interest of the multi-files parallelization. Therefore, users are discouraged from using these stages if alternatives are available. For example, `rasterize()` offers numerous native metrics coded in C++, making custom metrics coded in R unnecessary.

It is worth mentioning that the `lidR` package does not face this problem because each core runs a different and independent R session, thanks to the `future` package. While this approach has the advantage of being non blocking, it also comes with several inconveniences. In contrast, `lasR` utilizes only one R session to process multiple files in parallel. One consequences is that `lasR` will run `rasterize()` with custom metrics or `callback()` in parallel much slower than `lidR`.

With multiple files and complex pipeline, the overhead of blocking the pipeline for stages that use R *might* be less significant because once the pipelines are out of sync, the blocking stages *may* no longer occur simultaneously and thus cease to be blocking, as illustrated in the figure below with 8 files and 4 cores. This happens only if the blocking stages are quick behind the other stages.
