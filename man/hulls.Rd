\title{Contour of a point cloud}
\usage{
hulls(mesh = NULL, ofile = tempfile(fileext = ".gpkg"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{NULL or LASRalgorithm. A \code{triangulate} stage. If NULL take the bounding box of the
header of each file.}

\item{ofile}{character. Full outputs are always stored on disk. If \code{ofile = ""}
then the stage will not store the result on disk and will return nothing. It will however
hold partial output results temporarily in memory. This is useful for stage that are only
intermediate stage.}
}
\description{
This stage uses a Delaunay triangulation and computes its contour. The contour of a strict
Delaunay triangulation is the convex hull, but in lasR, the triangulation has a \code{max_edge} argument.
Thus, the contour might be a convex hull with holes. Used without triangulation it returns the bouding
box of the points.

\examples{
f <- system.file("extdata", "Topography.las", package = "lasR")
read <- reader(f)
tri <- triangulate(20, filter = keep_ground())
contour <- hulls(tri)
pipeline <- read + tri + contour
