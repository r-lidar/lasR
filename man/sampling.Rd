\title{Sample the point cloud keeping one random point per units}
\usage{
sampling_voxel(res = 2, filter = "")

sampling_pixel(res = 2, filter = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{numeric. voxel resolution}

\item{filter}{the 'filter' argument allows filtering of the point-cloud to work with points of
interest. The available filters are those from LASlib and can be found by running \link{filter_usage}.
For a given algorithm when a filter is applied, only the points that meet the criteria are processes.
The most common strings are "-keep_first", "-keep_class 2", "drop_z_below 2". For more details see
\link{filters}.}

\description{
Sample the point cloud, keeping one random point per pixel or per voxel. This stage modifies
the point cloud in the pipeline but does not produce any output.

\examples{
f <- system.file("extdata", "Topography.las", package="lasR")
read <- reader_las()
vox <- sampling_voxel(5)
write <- write_las()
pipeline <- read + vox + write
exec(pipeline, on = f)
