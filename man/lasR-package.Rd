\title{lasR: airborne LiDAR for forestry applications}
\description{
lasR provides a set of tools to process efficiently airborne LiDAR data in forestry contexts.
The package works with .las or .laz files. The toolbox includes algorithms for DSM, CHM, DTM, ABA,
normalisation, tree detection, tree segmentation, tree delineation, colourization, validation and
other tools, as well as a processing engine to process broad LiDAR coverage split into many files
efficiently.
