\usage{
classify_isolated_points(res = 5, n = 6L, class = 18L)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{numeric. Resolution of the voxels.}

\item{n}{integer. The maximal number of 'other points' in the 27 voxels.}

\item{class}{integer. The class to assign to the points that match the condition.}
}
\description{
The stage identifies points that have only a few other points in their surrounding
3 x 3 x 3 = 27 voxels and edits the points to assign a target classification. Used with class 18,
it classifies points as noise and is similar to \href{https://rapidlasso.de/lasnoise/}{lasnoise}
from LAStools. This stage modifies the point cloud in the pipeline but does not produce any output.
