\usage{
write_las(
  ofile = paste0(tempdir(), "/*.las"),
  filter = "",
  keep_buffer = FALSE,
  version = NULL,
  pdrf = NULL
)

write_copc(
  ofile = paste0(tempdir(), "/*.copc.laz"),
  filter = "",
  keep_buffer = FALSE,
  max_depth = NA,
  density = "dense"
)

write_pcd(ofile = paste0(tempdir(), "/*.pcd"), binary = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ofile}{character. Output file names. The string must contain a wildcard * so the wildcard can
be replaced by the name of the original tile and preserve the tiling pattern. If the wildcard
is omitted, everything will be written into a single file. This may be the desired behavior in some
circumstances, e.g., to merge some files.}

\item{filter}{the 'filter' argument allows filtering of the point-cloud to work with points of
interest. For a given stage when a filter is applied, only the points that meet the criteria are processed.
The most common strings are \verb{Classification == 2"}, \code{"Z > 2"}, \code{"Intensity < 100"}. For more details see
\link{filters}.}

\item{keep_buffer}{bool. The buffer is removed to write file but it can be preserved.}

\item{version}{integer. LAS format minor version to write. NULL or NA means it is auto-detected based
on the attributes of the point cloud. It writes either LAS 1.2 or LAS 1.4}

\item{pdrf}{integer. LAS point data record format. NULL or NA means it is auto-detected based
on the attributes of the point cloud.}

\item{max_depth}{integer. Maximum depth of the hierarchy. Default is NA meaning that is auto computes}

\item{density}{character. Can be 'sparse', 'normal' or 'dense'. It controls the point density per octant.
With 'sparce' each Octree octant is subdivided into 64 x 64 x 64 cells which mean that the density of point
is light. Normal is 128, dense is 256.}

\item{binary}{boolean. Write binary or ascii PCD files.}
}
\description{
Write the point cloud in LAS or LAZ or PCD files at any step of the pipeline (typically at the end).
Unlike other stages, the output won't be written into a single large file but in multiple tiled files
corresponding to the original collection of files.
}
\details{
\code{write_las} can write a COPC LAZ file simply by naming the output file with the ".copc.laz" extension.
However, users must be cautious. Writing COPC is not optimized for memory usage and requires two copies
of the point cloud in memory to ensure proper sorting and writing. If the user cannot afford to keep
two copies of the point cloud in RAM, they should use a more specialized writer such as Untwine (PDAL)
or lascopcindex (LAStools).\cr
\code{write_copc} is a wrapper around \code{write_las}, with a few extra arguments to control the COPC format.\cr
\code{write_pcd} cannot merge multiple files into one bigger file yet. It cannot write a subset of the file
either yet.
