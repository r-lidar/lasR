# lasR 0.3.2

- Fix: CRS are working on Windows
- Fix: `library(lasR)` transparently checks for latest version on Windows.

# lasR 0.3.1

- Fix: bugs when making a spatial query on multiple files with multiple spatial indexing systems (e.g. lax+nothing, lax+copc)

# lasR 0.3.0

- Change: `processor()` and `reader()` are deprecated and are replaced by `exec()` and `reader_las()`. This intends to provide a more consistent and natural way to separate the pipeline. i.e the stages and the global processing options i.e. the buffer, the chunking, the progress bar. For example the following now respects the `LAScatalog` processing options and this was not possible with the previous syntax.
  ```r
  ctg = lidR::readLAScatalog()
  pipeline = reader_las() + rasterize(...)
  exec(pipeline, on = ctg)
  ```
- New: the processor is now able to process by chunk like `lidR`
  ```r
  pipeline = reader_las() + rasterize(...)
  exec(pipeline, on = file, chunk = 500)
  ```
- New: stage `delete_points()` to remove some points in the pipeline.
- New: it is now possible to write the following:
  ```r
  dtm = dtm()
  pipeline <- read + dtm + transform_with(dtm[[2]])
  ```
- New: it is not possible to omit the reader stage. It automatically adds a default reader
  ```r
  pipeline = rasterize(...)
  exec(pipeline, on = ctg)
  ```
- New: triangulation is 4x faster and uses half the memory.
- Fix: `summarize()`, `rasterize()` and `write_las()` no longer process withheld points in streaming mode.

# lasR 0.2.1 (2024-03-05)

- Fix: `callback()` properly handles errors from the injected function
- New: handy functions `tempxyz()` to generate temp files with extension `.xyz`.
- New: `rasterize()` is now parallelized with internal metrics including for buffered area based approach
- New: `rasterize()` gained a progress bar with internal metrics.

# lasR 0.2.0 (2024-03-01)

- New: `rasterize()` gains the ability to perform a multi-resolution or buffered rasterization. See documentation.
- New: `rasterize()` gains numerous native metrics such as `zmax`, `zmean`, `zmedian`, `imax`, `imean` and so on.
- New: the internal engine gains the ability to skip the processing of some files of the collection and use these files only to load a buffer. This feature works with a `LAScatalog` from `lidR` respecting the `processed` attribute used in `lidR`
- Fix: loading the package being offline created a bug were R no longer handles errors.

# lasR 0.1.2 (2024-02-10)

- New: progress bar when reading the header of the files (`LAScatalog`) can be enabled with `progress = TRUE`
- Fix: progress bar starts to appear earlier i.e. from 0%. For some pipeline it affects the feeling of progress.

# lasR 0.1.1 (2024-02-08)

- Doc: Corrected the documentation for the argument `ncores` in `processor()`, which incorrectly mentioned that it was not supported.
- New: Added new functions `ncores()` and `half_cores()`.
- Fix: Corrected the reader progress bar display when reading a las file with a filter and a buffer.
- Fix: Fixed the overall progress bar, which was delayed by one file and was showing incorrect progress.
