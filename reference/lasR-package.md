# lasR: airborne LiDAR for forestry applications

lasR provides a set of tools to process efficiently airborne LiDAR data
in forestry contexts. The package works with .las or .laz files. The
toolbox includes algorithms for DSM, CHM, DTM, ABA, normalisation, tree
detection, tree segmentation, tree delineation, colourization,
validation and other tools, as well as a processing engine to process
broad LiDAR coverage split into many files efficiently.
