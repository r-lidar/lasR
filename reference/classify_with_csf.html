<dl><dt id="arg-slope-smooth">slope_smooth<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-slope-smooth"></a></dt>
<dd><p>logical. When steep slopes exist, set this parameter to TRUE to reduce
errors during post-processing.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-class-threshold">class_threshold<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-class-threshold"></a></dt>
<dd><p>scalar. The distance to the simulated cloth to classify a point cloud into ground
and non-ground. The default is 0.5.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-cloth-resolution">cloth_resolution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-cloth-resolution"></a></dt>
<dd><p>scalar. The distance between particles in the cloth. This is usually set to the
average distance of the points in the point cloud. The default value is 0.5.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-rigidness">rigidness<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-rigidness"></a></dt>
<dd><p>integer. The rigidness of the cloth. 1 stands for very soft (to fit rugged
terrain), 2 stands for medium, and 3 stands for hard cloth (for flat terrain). The default is 1.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-iterations">iterations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-iterations"></a></dt>
<dd><p>integer. Maximum iterations for simulating cloth. The default value is 500. Usually,
there is no need to change this value.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-time-step">time_step<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-time-step"></a></dt>
<dd><p>scalar. Time step when simulating the cloth under gravity. The default value
is 0.65. Usually, there is no need to change this value. It is suitable for most cases.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg--">...<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg--"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Unused</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-class">class<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-class"></a></dt>
<dd><p>integer. The classification to attribute to the points. Usually 2 for ground points.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-filter">filter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-filter"></a></dt>
<dd><p>the 'filter' argument allows filtering of the point-cloud to work with points of
interest. For a given stage when a filter is applied, only the points that meet the criteria are processed.
The most common strings are <code>Classification == 2"</code>, <code>"Z &gt; 2"</code>, <code>"Intensity &lt; 100"</code>. For more details see
<a href="filters.html">filters</a>.</p></dd>
